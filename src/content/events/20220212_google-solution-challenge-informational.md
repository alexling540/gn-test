Howdy!

The Google Developer Student Club at Texas A&M University will be hosting a Google Solution Challenge Informational on Thursday Nov 18th from 6:30-7:30 PM CDT in PETR 118 (L.F. Peterson Building). We will be giving an overview of what the Google Solution Challenge is and how you can participate and compete in this annual event! We'll be providing you with all of the resources you'll need to get started but make sure to come prepared with any questions you might have.

Go ahead and RSVP for this event if you're interested! And if you haven't already, join our Slack at [tx.ag/gdscslack](https://tx.ag/gdscslack). We will be using it for communication throughout the year, and it's a great place to network with your peers.
