Howdy!

Are you looking to work at tech companies large and small? Do you have a technical interview coming up and don't know how to start preparing?

Join us this week for Technical Interviews 101 , a presentation by GDSC Lead Jack Sebastian on Thursday Oct 14th from 6:30-7:30 PM CDT in PETR 118 (L.F. Peterson Building). He will be giving an in-depth explanation of what a technical interview is and how to ace it!

If you haven't already, join our Slack at tx.ag/gdscslack. We will be using it for communication throughout the year, and it's a great place to network with your peers.

Looking forward to seeing all of you at the event on Thursday! Thanks and gig 'em!
