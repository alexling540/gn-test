Howdy!

The Google Developer Student Club will be hosting a Course Scheduling Social this Thursday Mar 31st from 7:00-7:30 PM CDT.

If you're planning your schedule for Fall 2022 and need help deciding which classes to take, we encourage you to attend. You can get advice from our officers as they've already taken those classes in the past. So, feel free to stop by and ask questions!

Go ahead and RSVP for this event! Zoom link: [tx.ag/gdscmeet](http://tx.ag/gdscmeet)

If you haven't already, join our Slack at [tx.ag/gdscslack](http://tx.ag/gdscslack). We will be using it for communication throughout the year, and it's a great place to network with your peers.

Looking forward to seeing all of you at the event! Thanks and gig 'em!
