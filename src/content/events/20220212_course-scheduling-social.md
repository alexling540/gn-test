Howdy!



The Google Developer Student Club will be hosting a Course Scheduling Social this Thursday Nov 4th from 6:30-7:30 PM CDT in PETR 118 (L.F. Peterson Building).



If you're planning your schedule for Spring 2022 and need help deciding which classes to take, we encourage you to attend. You can get advice from our officers as they've already taken those classes in the past. So, feel free to stop by and ask questions!



Here's the Zoom link for the event if you can't make it in person:Â <https://tamu.zoom.us/j/95147172187?pwd=Qk00NmJKbVJmaFQvRkV3K2FOWHpMZz09>



If you haven't already, join our Slack at [tx.ag/gdscslack](https://tx.ag/gdscslack). We will be using it for communication throughout the year, and it's a great place to network with your peers.



Looking forward to seeing all of you at the event on Thursday! Thanks and gig 'em!
